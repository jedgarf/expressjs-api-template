Nowhere to go, and dead, Yusuke becomes a ghost and must earn his way back into existence.<br><br>\nYusuke is \"employed\" by Koenma, who is in charge while his father and ruler of the afterlife, King Enma, is away. Under Koenma's command, Yusuke helps to stop menacing demons that threaten the lives of people everywhere; whether by stealing priceless and invaluable items and destructive weapons, or by wreaking havoc on humans everywhere.<br><br>\nThroughout Yusuke's journey, he is usually joined by; his arch-rival, and local bully, Kuwabara Kazuma.

But as Koenma looks out his window he can tell this is no ordinary storm. The floodwaters continue to rise, and just before they become too much for Koenma he gives a mysterious item to Botan, and tells her to give it to Yusuke Urameshi. But Botan gets hurt badly and barely makes it to Yusuke. Botan is too weak to give Yusuke the item. Throughout most of the movie she’s unconscious and is unable to do anything, while a great evil is surfacing. The storm was apparently caused by the forces of the Netherworld, which was banished into cold space ages ago. All this happens pretty quickly, and so does the fighting. We get to see Yusuke and the others do their signature attacks, against some of their toughest opponents yet. To restore balance in the now flooded Spirit world, Yusuke and the others must track down five spots on Earth that contain a large amount of spiritual energy. But their simple plans get turned upside down when the ruler of the Netherworld, Yakumo, and his three henchmen decide to use the same energy for evil. So, the race begins to save the Spirit World, and now the Human World as well.",

The masked fighter is forced to take a hit for Yusuke, when he's busy yelling at Kuwabara. She's thrown back and slammed into the side of the ring, presumably unconscious. It's up to Yusuke and Kuwabara to fend for themselves in the ring. . .and they're failing miserably. Kuwabara still refuses to fight, however, intent on rescuing from their dark fates. Ichigaki eggs them on, still in glee over the Urameshi Team's .05% percentage of victory. Kuwabara leaves himself open for a critical blow, still trying to figure out what's wrong with them, but the masked figher once again does crushing blow to his attacker, sending him sprawling. Her mask in tatters, she's revealed to be a short, young woman with pink hair, and a beautiful face. Everyone is surprised that the fighter isn't Genkai, like they had assumed. She berates them for standing still",

She starts chanting in a strange tounge, and then seems to paralyze the warriors in their tracks. She stabs them each in the heart with her finger, and then stops, and they fall to the ground, presumably dead. Kuwabara and Yusuke are both shocked at her methods, but she assures them that it was all that she could have done.\nWith that done, the Urameshi Team confronts Ichigaki himself. The coward still tries to weasel himself out, saying that their master is still sick, and only he has the cure. Hiei and Kurama prove him wrong, however, when the master of the dojo appears from the hallway, standing, although a bit weak. Hiei says that after beating up Ichigaki's fifth fighter, they found the whereabouts of the master, and Kurama easily created a cure for the minor illness. With no other way out, Ichigaki injects himself with a strange serum, morphing him into a huge, hulking beast with stretch",

Team Urameshi's next match will begin immediately against Team Masho, five demons veiled in black cloaks. But a scheme by Team Masho's owner ensnares Hiei and the Masked Fighter before the fight! They get trapped inside a powerful forcefield by a readhead enchantress working for Team Masho, disguised as a nurse. With Kuwabara badly injured, that means the footsore Yusuke and Kurama will have to take this entire team alone!\nKurama says he'll take out the first three warriors. So his first oponent is Gama, a master of makeup. He uses his makeup attack on Kurama called Makeup of Chains making Kurama's arms and legs useless.

And like in the last episode, Gama tries to hit Kurama through his wounds, splattering his blood all over him.  Right before he dies, Gama tells Kurama that his blood has sealed his spirit energy.  Uh-oh.  To make matters worse, the next member, Touya is ready to fight and avenge his dead teammate.\nTouya attacks just as Gama's first spell wears off, allowing him to move, but with his energy still sealed, he's still in a bad situation.  Kurama spends all of the time trying to keep himself from getting killed by Touya's attacks.  Eventually, he forms a plan to defeat Touya, and gets himself cut on purpose to plant one of his death plant seeds inside his own body right so it can manifest as a weapon.  Right as Touya as is about to deliver a death blow, Kurama's death plant finally sprouts, and he has it",

After the battle, Recca finally acknowledged Kagero as his mother and tried to check if she was alright, but found out that he is unable to touch her, as the forbidden spell that Kagero used ensured that mother and son cannot make contact.

He also told that the Urabutousatsoujin is based on killing as a sport. In the end of the episode, Kukai prepares to smash Recca's head. ",

So Tokiya decided to fight Mokuren. During the fight, Mokuren's branches grow after being cut by Tokiya. Kagero revealed that the source of Mokuren's power comes from the Kodama madogu implanted in Mokuren's face. Near the end of the fight, Tokiya pierces his sword to the ground where Mokuren interpreted it as an act of submission. In reality, he froze the entire ring to freeze Mokuren as well. He eventually finds and rescues Koganei due to the fact of heat conductivity where metals react first in freezing temperatures (which in this case, Koganei's golden cross gave Tokiya the signal of the former's location).

                "description": "During the first test, a number of participants fall out from fatigue after running for at least forty kilometers. Leorio almost gives up until he is encouraged by Gon, who waits for him. Killua, a participant, is introduced and he is curious of Gon's personality when he discovers that the boy is the same age as him. Kurapika and Leorio talk about the reason for being a hunter, with Kurapika wanting to take down the Phantom Troupe as his clan was massacred by them for their precious scarlet eyes, which manifest when the Kurta uses their heightened sense. Leorio aims to be a hunter for money, for purely altruistic reasons, as his childhood friend died of an illness without the funds to save him. He wishes to be a doctor so he can give his patients free treatment. Finally, the participants reach the end of the tunnel they are in and up to the surface to the Numere Wetlands, also known as Swindlers' Swamp. Satotz warns them about the creatures using devious tactics to lure and eat their prey in the wetlands, and falling for their tricks equals death. A man claiming to be their original examiner says Satotz is a man-faced ape masquerading as their examiner to fool them. Hisoka, in the belief that a well-trained Hunter would be able to avoid attacks, throws his playing cards on Satotz and the man. The man is killed while Satotz stops the attack, revealing himself to be the real examiner. Hisoka is warned not to attack Satotz again otherwise he will be disqualified. Satotz tells the participants to follow him into the swamp, and if any of them loses sight of him, they will never reach the second venue.",

A group of candidates target Hisoka as they feel he's a threat. Gon and Killua are separated from Leorio and Kurapika and both sides are eventually attacked by monsters. Leorio and Kurapika encounter Hisoka about to be attacked by candidates but are shocked to watch the magician easily take the candidates down. Hisoka then targets Leorio and Kurapika, but realizing that they are no match for him, they decide to head in different directions to stop him from following. However, Leorio returns, unable to run away from a fight. As expected, Leorio is beaten badly by Hisoka. Before the melee can get any worse, Gon, who is separated from Killua, arrives to stop Hisoka. Although he is also no match for Hisoka, he manages to hit his face once before being strangled by Hisoka.",

Satotz leads what remains of the candidates to meet the second phase examiners, named Menchi and Buhara. The examiners declare the next phase is to test their cooking skills, much to the candidates' disbelief. The test requires pork, so the candidates are sent to find pigs in the forest. However, the pigs living inside the forest are carnivorous and tear through the candidates. Thanks to Gon, they discover the pigs' weakness and they manage to each get one for their cooking. Upon tasting the candidates' cooking, Buhara gives a pass but Menchi fails all of them. Knowing the candidates will riot, Satotz informs Chairman Netoros of the Hunter Selection Committee to make an appearance. Netoros arrives to correct Menchi's habit of getting biased whenever it's related to cooking. Netoros allows Menchi to stay on as examiner, and she gives the candidates a retest: boil eggs laid by spider eagles on Mt. Split-in-Half. The candidates ride on Netoros' airship to the mountain where they learn they have to jump down a potentially fatal height to get the eggs. Having seen and learnt how Menchi gets her egg, Gon leads some of the other candidates into successfully getting their own. Some candidates are killed while rashly trying to get their eggs while others refuse to take the leap. Out of the 50 candidates who survive to reach Phase Two, 42 candidates now remain.",

Gon and Killua explore the airship, and Killua tells Gon that he is actually from a family of assassins. He wished to strike out on his own, which his family has not taken lightly. Neteros arrives and tests both boys' instinct and asks how they felt about the difficulty of the exam. Neteros invites both of them to a game, whoever can grab the ball he is holding before dawn will immediately pass the exam. Gon and Killua find it too hard to pass up, but discovers that with Neteros' skills, they are unable to grab the ball. Eventually Killua realizes that with their skills, they will never be able to take the ball from Neteros for a year, if he keeps it up. Killua retires, but then takes it out on two candidates who harass him, by maiming and killing them. Gon continues trying to grab the ball, and uses a headbutt on Neteros. The old man realizes that Gon will crack his skull if he continues with his headbutt, so he uses his right hand to push Gon away from him. Gon then tells Neteros then he has managed to get him to use his right hand once, which he had not used from the start of the challenge. After his speech, Gon falls asleep from exhaustion.",

An experienced rock climber candidate tries to climb down but is eaten by some flying monsters. Later, Kurapika finds that more than half of the candidates have discovered hidden doors to go inside the tower, which Gon finds one as well. However, the catch is that there are many hidden doors, each one can be only used once and only one person can fit through a door, which means they have to split up. When they try out different doors, they realize that they end up in the same room. In the room, Gon's group are given instructions and special wristwatches for five of them to follow the majority, but they cannot proceed without a fifth member. Lippo, one of the Phase 3 examiners tells them this while explaining they have chosen the path of majority rule.",

Gon chooses the longer candle, unaware that it is oil-soaked, and his candle starts to burn faster midway. Seeing that his candle is not susceptible to strong winds, he puts it down and sprints towards Sedokan to blow his candle. The next match is between Kurapika and Majitani, who proposes a death match without weapons and and with the condition that one must die or surrender to finish the match.

Hisoka then becomes the first applicant to pass this phase. Meanwhile, the team suspects Majitani's real condition. The female prisoner challenges Leorio to have a betting game instead. Leorio agrees and bets ten hours that Majitani is alive, which he wins. Next, he bets twenty hours on Majitani feigning unconsciousness. To confirm, he brings Majitani to the edge of the platform and threatens to drop him. Seeing that, the prisoner changes her bet to forty hours on Majitani being conscious.

Leorio then challenges Leroute in rock, paper, scissors, and loses. Killua then faces the feared mass murderer Johness the Dissector. Killua rips Johness' heart in an instant and even have it covered in a piece of Johness' cloth. The latter pleads for his heart, and Killua returned it after he is dead.

        "description": "Gold Roger was known as the Pirate King, the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and death of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the location of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece (which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame), and quite possibly the most coveted of titles for the person who found it, the title of the Pirate King.<br><br>\nEnter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy that defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate who ransacks villages for fun, Luffy’s reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder; the thought of an exciting adventure and meeting new and intriguing people, along with finding One Piece, are his reasons of becoming a pirate. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach One Piece.<br><br>\n<b>*This includes following special episodes:</b><br>\n- Chopperman to the Rescue! Protect the TV Station by the Shore! (Episode 336)<br>\n- The Strongest Tag-Team! Luffy and Toriko's Hard Struggle! (Episode 492)<br>\n- Team Formation! Save Chopper (Episode 542)<br>\n- History's Strongest Collaboration vs. Glutton of the Sea (Episode 590)<br>\n- 20th Anniversary! Special Romance Dawn (Episode 907)",

Robin catches him before he hits the water and the boy regains consciousness in the Straw Hats' cabin. Scared at first, he loosens up when presented by Sanji with a soup of surprising quality. The small cook reveals his problem: he spilled the day's production of curry and has been charged with replacing it. To compound the issue, the fleet's captains plan to dine aboard his ship. Luffy and Sanji take Tajiyo back to his ship, where Sanji provides him with subtle cooking advice. Tajiyo's new curry turns out perfectly and the Straw Hats escape before the fog lifts in the mid-day sun.",

Chopper charges repeatedly, but his transformations are erratic and difficult to control. By the time he assumes the correct form, he is too weak and is struck down.

Sanji attempts to take Zoro's place, but Zoro knocks him out. As part of his agreement with Kuma, Zoro takes in all of Luffy's pain and fatigue, which Kuma says would kill him if he suffered it on top of his already severe wounds. Zoro takes in the pain, and Kuma leaves, remarking on how Luffy has a loyal crew. Luffy regains consciousness, surprisingly energetic, while Zoro emerges from his sacrifice near death.",

After Gunpei wakes up and begins to drive, Mizuhashi drove up beside him and signaled to him that she has something to tell him. Gunpei lowers his window which causes the fishing line to tighten around his neck and causes his death. Mizuhashi confesses and reveals Furuki challenged Akira a race but in the race there was a storm that it must not be a conditions of a race causing Akira's car swept by the slippery floor and fell in the depths of the valley where the race happened and died with his hands clinched to the steering wheel. Shinichi tells Mizuhashi that Gunpei actually regrets his actions that he done when Akira's death in the past, meaning that Gunpei knows about Mizuhashi's plan for murdering him all along. He willingly accepted his death so he can pay the actions he done in the past. After solving the murder, the antidote to the APTX 4869 begins to wear off and Shinichi begins to change back to Conan; He attempts to seclude himself for the transformation but Ran grabs onto his hand and refuses to let go.",

He says that their scars are too long. Kurumi Shodo said that the scar stretched across the boy's body, however, when a boy grows, the scar does not grow as well, it would stay the same size. A scar that was huge on the boy would seem small on a man. Kusumoto and Banba's scars are huge, so they couldn't fit into such a desciption.\nConan realizes and declares that Shodo's butler, Taisuke Hoya, is the boy from her past and that Kurumi most likely already knew for a while now and is using the public attention to try and get him to confess knowing he would never tell her otherwise because of his selflessness. He not only mentions this, but also adds that that the boy's nickname was revealed to be 'gari' because he liked to eat Gari, the pickled ginger served with sushi to cleans the palate. As proof, he points out that Hoya is the only one who ate the sushi pieces that contained gari.\nHoya admits that he was the boy, and says he cannot openly reveal it because the accident where he got scarred is also the one where Shodou got the injuries that ultimately rendered her blind. Conan explains Shodo's reasons and how she always knew he was the one she cared for; then he urges Hoya to go speak to her privately, which he does.\nLater, Kiyonaga Matsumoto barges in and accuses Ryuhei Kusumoto of being the serial killer from a past case.

                "description": "The next day, a TV show features the case with this serial killer, which is three days away of being definitely closed. A popular criminal psychologist named Douji Hiramune is one of the guests and he arrogantly challenges the serial killer to reveal himself, even daring him to come kill him if he wishes so. Hiramune happens to live in the same apartment complex as Ayumi, where the Detective Boys are staying over since she's home alone. Haibara and Ai go for food and drinks, and when they return she reveals to Conan that she saw a mysterious man whistling Let It Be which is the serial killer's trademark.\nConan immediately contacts Takagi, Chiba and Sato and tells them that the killer is around. He then tells the others to stay put and runs out of the Yoshida apartment, finds Hiramune's flat and sees the door is open. He steps in and finds Hiramune murdered, with the letter Z slashed into his back and his throat slashed... exactly like all but one of the serial killer's victims, who died either 20 (three of them) or 15 (the last one) years ago.\n(The victim who wasn't stabbed, Matsumoto's best friend/Megure's mentor Morimura, was ran over by the killer's car during the first days of the murder investigation, bleeding to death in Matsumoto's arms. Additionally, Matsumoto later confronted the suspect they were chasing after and got slashed across his eye, gaining his trademark scar.)\nThe police department arrive and are confused as the letter they were expecting was N as the previous victims had the letters E, S, W and were thought to be cardinal direction.\nConan and the police notice Hiramune's left hand was on his keyboard on the keys Ctrl and C and his right hand holding the wire of his mouse. Takagi and the Detective Boys decide to accompany him and his interrogation of the victim's relatives: Boukawa's widow, Mugita's younger brother, and Nabei's son. Conan than realizes the victims share one thing in connection, Mahjong. It's confirmed that 20 years ago, all the victims save for Morimura attended a popular Mahjong parlor on a regular basis.",

                "description": "Later, Takagi comes to the conclusion that a man named Dokurou Kibo is the serial killer. Aside of his past as an ex-con, Kibo had some very incriminating actions und his belt: he used to bicker about different themes with the victims in the parlor, and the last one (which he had with Hiramune alone) finished with him flipping their table (and damaging the tiles on it) while loudly swearing to kill them. After talking with said parlor manager, Takagi takes one of the old and damaged Mahjong tiles and keeps it in his pocket.\nIn the meantime Matsumoto, having learned about Takagi's more daring attitude in this case and how he and Satou were planning to go to a spa once it was all over, fears for Takagi's safety. He says that many times, when a someone in the police makes a promise to his loved ones, he or she is likely to die in the line of duty; he adds that Morimura was one month away from getting married and died when, during the case, he got reckless in an attempt to impress his girlfriend...\n\nDokurou Kibo is properly apprehended, but he has a powerful alibi: he was been in jail in the years between the last victim's death and Hiramune's murder, so he cannot be the killer and he doesn't intend to commit any crimes from then on. Even more so, he doesn't recognize Matsumoto, which would make no sense since Matsumoto was a member of the original investigation team and was attacked by the killer. Matsumoto adds that he felt pain in his scar when interrogating Kusumoto and when Hiramune's corpse was found, but upon seeing Kibo he felt nothing on it, which he sees as a signal that the case is about to be resolved.\nConan notices something strange about Hiramune's dying message, and realizes this indicates the person who murdered him was a copycat killer. He was found pressing the C key of his computer and had arranged the mouse's cord to look like a rat's tail, hinting at a 'cat' being involved; 'Copycat killers0 are named as such because they imitate other killers, just like kittens learn to hunt imitating their parents.\nConan reveals to Sato that Douji Hiramune was actually the serial killer from the past and that Eiki Nabei murdered him. Nabei Jr. had sort-of witnessed his father's murder as a child, having been in the room next door; he heard a part of his father's talk with his killer (but since they spoke in mahjong terms, he didn't understand the core of it), as well as the killer's whistling, and was the only of the three relatives who knew both details (Boukawa's widow and Mugita's brother only knew about the mahjong). 15 years later Nabei saw Hiramune's challenge on the TV, recalled such details and realised he was the one who murdered his dad and others; he located Hiramune and murdered him in the same way he used to kill his victims... in other words, he became a copycat killer. Nabei Jr. was also the person Haibara saw around the day Hiramune died, which happened right after he had his revenge.\nAdditionally, Conan says that Hiramune also killed Morimura and scarred Matsumoto when they were this close to actually catch him; in return, Matsumoto managed to snatch Hiramune's katana and slash him across his back... and that's the actual reason why Hiramune had a Z carved on his corpse: Eiki Nabei had noticed that scar after killing him and carved the Z to hide it, attempting to throw the police off and make them chase after a murderer that was already dead.\nTakagi, who prior to this had been ordered to bring Eiki Nabei to the police station so he would meet up with Dokuro Kibo, steps into the apparently empty Nabei household. He's then attacked from behind, beaten bloody with a baseball bat, and handcuffed by the very angry Nabei...\nWhen Takagi regains consciousness, he asks Nabei Jr. if he's the new killer, and Nabei confirms it and explains that he killed Hiramune as revenge for his father Susumu Nabei, murdered in the same house.\n20 years ago Hiramune, Mugita, Nabei Sr. and Boukawa usually discussed about perfect crimes while playing mahjong, and at some point the last three hotly disagreed with Hiramune (then a very promising psychology student), who believed that the 'perfect crime' existed. Boukawa and Mugita were the ones who showed more repulse and specially when Hiramune said he wanted to prove his theories, so he killed them with a katana that he stole from Boukawa's home out of fear they would publically denounce him as a prospect killer and ruin his future.\nNabei Sr. knew all of this and stayed quiet out of fear, believing that he contributed to the crime by joking around and not taking Hiramune seriously. Five years later, however, he couldn't withstand his guilt, told Hiramune to come to his house and asaid that they should turn themselves in, so Hiramune killed him too. Nabei Jr. heard the discussion and Hiramune's whistling, and kept it to himself until he learned about the deadline for the investigation of his dad's murder and saw Hiramune on TV, which made him contact Hiramune under the excuse of having extra information about the crimes...\nWhen Nabei Jr. finishes the 'tale', Takagi's cellphone beeps: it's Satou, who has been told to join him. Nabei sees this as a chance to set a hostage situation, refers to Satou as Takagi's girlfriend and tries to force Takagi to reply but Takagi breaks his cellphone instead, which alerts Satou and makes her call for reinforcements. Matsumoto immediately sends a whole squad to both apprehend Nabei and rescue Takagi.\nNabei Jr. gets angry, takes his baseball bat and beats Takagi even bloodier. Then he sees someone getting close to the door, which distracts him from Takagi; he sees this as a chance and tries to tackle him down. Nabei, however, reacts and shoots him in the chest...\nAt the hospital Shiratori greets Satou and the Detective Kids, who think Takagi died due to the promise he made to Sato. He calms them down and reveals that Takagi's life was saved by the mahjong tile he had in his shirt pocket, which stopped the bullet that would've killed him otherwise. Megure arrives and says that thanks to Takagi distracting Nabei from the other policemen, they managed to apprehend him easier and nobody else was injured; now he's right out of surgery, and soundly asleep.\nThe next morning, Sato visits Takagi in his room and tells him that the whistling came from Hiramune remembering the days spent in the mahjong parlor before he killed his partners. She then tells him that they won't be able to go to the spa since he's injured, and he dejectedly says that it's always so close, referring to the times when he and Sato almost kissed. Then, she smiles and leans even closer...\nWhen Megure, Matsumoto, Chiba and Shiratori approach the roo to visit Takagi, the Detective Boys tell him he's asleep and convince them to return later. When they're gone, they open the door and are overjoyed to see Satou leaning over Takagi, happily kissing him on the lips.",

As Conan was being comfortable at home, Professor Agasa suddenly called him because their car suddenly stopped and something went wrong so they happen to call a towing truck for it to be carried back and have them stop at the bus stop but unfortunately for Agasa, he lost his wallet somewhere. Agasa asked if Kogoro Mouri could give them a ride towards home but he wasn't there so Conan thought up of the idea to have Subaru Okiya fetch them. Haibara immediately took the phone and denied the idea of having them fetch due to his suspiciousness.\nFortunately for them, a car came with two people in it, a woman with sunglasses and a hat, and a man with a coat covering half of his face with his unshaved hair. They were invited by the woman without telling the man who was asleep. The woman, who was telling them to go in, said a strange line about the back being packed. Afterwards, Haibara notices that there are holes matching bullet holes and a recently cleaned car but with blood stains between the seats. As they just got in Tokyo, they met a traffic. They continue to chat and seemingly, they are interested in Conan and went to the Mouri Detective Agency. As Agasa was about to say something about their relationship between Kogoro, Haibara stops him from doing so, and acts as though she suddenly felt sleepy and tired. The woman suggested them to sleep while they are in a car because it will take them time.\nWhen Haibara and Agasa pretended to sleep, they overheard their conversation about half-killing and overkilling. After hearing those words, they assumed that they are a dangerous group. By shock, the woman noticed Agasa awake and assumed he was listening to their conversation with a glare look. In a sudden, they guy also made a strange line to fly back. It surprised them a lot what those words meant and riding in a dangerous group.\n\nThey got on a diner after making their minds. As the two of them with Agasa talked, Ai was excusing herself to go the bathroom where in fact, she was going there to make a call to Conan. Conan was worried and had to go there with his skateboard. He told them to make a bad excuse and surely, they are smart enough to uncover the excuse made up by Conan so that they can hide for a while.\nAgasa and Haibara hid in the men's bathroom. The man knocked on every stall and asked them to talk. When it was their stall that was coming up, they asked Conan what to do. Conan made another ridiculous idea to have Haibara shout like an adult in the men's bathroom. With a follow-up plan, Conan asked them to escape through the window but seemingly, it was all planned out. The woman was already guarding the outside and the man just came. Conan also made a strange line telling them to just surrender and give up.\n\nWhen Conan reached to that place, it was as though they were betrayed by him but actually, the two of them were police officers (Yui Uehara and Kansuke Yamato) and were worried that they would escape without going back to their home. Yui Uehara told them that she as wearing dark glasses to hide her bruise when they were up in a fight with a suspect so as with Kansuke Yamato who had damaged himself right above his forehead. When they came to the Mouri Detective Agency, it was actually them asking for help to solve the mystery of the Red Wall but they actually are ahead for Conan with his sharp mind.",

By the time he arrives at Professor Oak's, the three Pokemon he wanted have already been chosen by the other Trainers-in-training, including his rival, Gary! The only Pokemon remaining is a strong-willed Pikachu.\n\nTrainer and Pokemon don't get along right away. Not only does Pikachu refuse to enter its Poke Ball, it would rather climb a tree than battle a Pidgey that Ash encounters! Disagreements aside, they start to bond when they find themselves chased by an angry flock of Spearow. The Spearow wound Pikachu, but Ash risks his own safety to protect his Pokemon.\n\nTo further their escape, Ash borrows a bike owned by a young girl named Misty. He soon wrecks the bike, however, and he and Pikachu are surrounded by the Spearow. When Ash fearlessly confronts the Spearow, Pikachu is inspired to summon its remaining energy to repel the Pokemon with a powerful electric shock.\n\nFinally out of harm's way, the wild experience makes Ash and Pikachu realize that they've begun what promises to be a blooming friendship.",

While Nurse Joy transports Poke Balls to Pewter City for safety, Ash tries to fight off Team Rocket's Pokemon, Koffing and Ekans. Ash is having no luck battling, so his Pikachu, still recovering, teams up with a bunch of other Pikachu at the Pokemon Center to blast Team Rocket out of the building!\n\nHaving discovered that Ash's Pikachu is not your ordinary Pikachu, Jessie, James, and Meowth make it their mission to capture it.\n\nWith the bad guys expelled, Misty joins Ash and Pikachu on their journey to Pewter City. While strolling through Viridian Forest, a Caterpie makes an appearance. Ash sees an opportunity for his first Pokemon capture. Will he be successful?",

Before Ash can celebrate too wildly, Misty reminds him that his success is due more to luck than skill.\n\nTeam Rocket shows up to steal Pikachu—they realize that there's really something special about this Pokemon—and Ash vows to defend himself. Pikachu and Pidgeotto are weakened by Koffing and Ekans, so he reluctantly sends out Caterpie. To the surprise of Jessie and James—not to mention Ash—Caterpie's String Shot is able to defeat the Team Rocket Pokemon, including Meowth!\n\nWhen Misty tries to make nice with Caterpie, it evolves into a Metapod.

Moments prior to his birth, a huge demon known as the Kyuubi, the Nine-tailed Fox, attacked Konohagakure and wreaked havoc. In order to put an end to the Kyuubi's rampage, the leader of the village, the 4th Hokage, sacrificed his life and sealed the monstrous beast inside the newborn Naruto. <br><br>\nShunned because of the presence of the Kyuubi inside him, Naruto struggles to find his place in the village. He strives to become the Hokage of Konohagakure, and he meets many friends and foes along the way. <br><br>\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)",
